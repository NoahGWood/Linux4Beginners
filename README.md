## F.A.Q.

### What is a "distro"?

A **distro**, or distribution, sometimes called a 'flavor', is a specific implementation of Linux. The largest distros are:

* Debian
* Red Hat
* Suse
* Arch

Almost all major distributions (e.g. Fedora, OpenSuse, Ubuntu, etc.) derive from these versions of Linux. **No**, if you're wondering, you should not use **any** of them as a beginner. 

### Which Linux OS Should I Use?

I highly recommend using [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), it is one of the easiest and most intuitive distros, and it is the distro which I personally use. Linux Mint is based off of [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) which is another beginner-friendly distro

### What about [some random] distro?

I may get some flack from the community for saying this, but ultimately the **best** distro for beginners is going to be either Ubuntu or Linux Mint, both of which are based on Debian.
